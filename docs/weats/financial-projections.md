| **1** | $2.41 | $1.45 | $0.96 | 40% |
| **2** | $2.53 | $1.54 | $0.99 | 39% |
| **3** | $2.65 | $1.62 | $1.03 | 39% |

### Break-Even Calculation

**Year 1:**
```
Fixed costs: $30,333/month = $10M COP/month
Contribution margin: $3,940 COP/order ($0.96)
Break-even orders: 10M / 3,940 = 2,538 orders/month = 85 orders/day

Target: 100-200 orders/day
Status: BELOW break-even (need investment)
```

**Year 2:**
```
Fixed costs: $91,500/month = $378.5M COP/month
Contribution margin: $4,090 COP/order ($0.99)
Break-even orders: 378.5M / 4,090 = 92,542 orders/month = 3,085 orders/day

Target: 1,000-1,500 orders/day
Status: BELOW break-even, but approaching
```

**Year 3:**
```
Fixed costs: $168,334/month = $696M COP/month
Contribution margin: $4,240 COP/order ($1.03)
Break-even orders: 696M / 4,240 = 164,151 orders/month = 5,472 orders/day

Target: 3,000-5,000 orders/day
Status: Approaching/AT break-even
```

**Key Insight:** Break-even moves as scale increases (fixed costs grow), but target is 5,000 orders/day in Year 3 which covers all fixed costs + generates $715K-$1M profit.

## CAPITAL EFFICIENCY

### GMV per Dollar Raised

| Company | GMV | Funding | GMV/$ Raised |
|---------|-----|---------|--------------|
| **Weats (Year 3)** | $100M | $7.5M | **$13.33** |
| **Rappi (Current)** | $3.17B | $2.46B | $1.29 |
