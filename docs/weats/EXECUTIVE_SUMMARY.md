# WPFOODS: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
## Disrupting Rappi Through Fair Economics and AI-Powered WhatsApp Delivery

**Date:** October 11, 2025
**Prepared For:** Investors, Partners, and Stakeholders

---

## THE OPPORTUNITY

**Market:** Colombian food delivery is a $3.17B GMV market dominated by Rappi (64% share). Despite this dominance, **all three stakeholders are dissatisfied:**

**Customers:** Pay **40% premium** over restaurant prices ($0 for $30 food → $42 with Rappi)
**Restaurants:** Lose **25-35% to fees**, making delivery unprofitable for many
**Workers:** Earn **below minimum wage** after expenses (48% pay decline since 2022)

**The Problem:** Rappi extracts 44% of every order ($54,820 COP on $124,000 COP order) while delivering subpar value. This creates a massive opportunity for disruption.

---

## THE SOLUTION: WPFOODS

**WPFoods is a WhatsApp-based food delivery platform that uses AI automation to deliver 10x better economics:**

- Same or lower menu prices (no markup)
- **Total savings: $6-8 per order**

### For Restaurants: 5-10% Fees (Save 15-25 Points)

- **Geography:** Zona T + Chicó (2 wealthy neighborhoods)
- **Target:** 500 beta → 10,000 customers
- **Orders/day:** 20 → 200
- **Strategy:** Prove model, word-of-mouth, guerrilla marketing

### Phase 2: Bogotá Expansion (Months 7-12)
- **Geography:** +5 neighborhoods (Usaquén, Chapinero, etc.)
- **Target:** 10K → 50K customers
- **Orders/day:** 200 → 1,500

## COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS

### Why Rappi Cannot Respond Effectively

**Option 1: Match Prices**
- Revenue drops 59-79% ($764M-$1B annual loss)
- Still has 60-68% higher operational costs
- **Result: Financial suicide**

**Option 2: Rebuild Platform (WhatsApp + AI)**
- Timeline: 18-24 months
- Cost: $50-100M
- Organizational resistance: 12,600 employees can't pivot to 15-person model
- **Result: Too slow, too expensive, too disruptive**

**Option 3: Acquire WPFoods**
- Year 3-4 valuation: $50-150M
- **Most likely outcome if WPFoods successful**

**Option 4: Do Nothing (Year 1)**
- "Too small to matter" (0.5% market share)
- **WPFoods uses this window to establish defensible position**

### Defensibility: Network Effects at 10,000 Customers

**Once WPFoods reaches 10,000 loyal customers:**
- Restaurant lock-in: 500 restaurants exclusive (12-month contracts)
- Worker loyalty: 200 workers earning 2x Rappi (will recruit others)
- Customer habits: 80% retention, 4 orders/month, LTV $93.84
- Data moat: Consumer insights difficult to replicate
- Brand: "Fair delivery" position owned

**Displacement cost for Rappi:** $30-50M+ (customer acquisition + restaurant incentives)
