## COMPLETE FEE STRUCTURE BREAKDOWN

### Example Order Economics

**Scenario:** $50,000 COP Order

**Revenue and Fees:**
```
Customer order subtotal:        $50,000 COP

RAPPI TAKES:
- Commission (25%):             -$12,500 COP
- Payment processing (2.5%):     -$1,250 COP
- Delivery fee:                  -$2,500 COP
────────────────────────────────────────
Total deductions:               -$16,250 COP (32.5%)

RESTAURANT RECEIVES:
Net payment:                    $33,750 COP (67.5%)
```

**Profitability Analysis:**

If restaurant's food cost is 30% and labor/overhead is 30%:
```
Order subtotal:                 $50,000 COP
Food cost (30%):               -$15,000 COP
Labor/overhead (30%):          -$15,000 COP
Rappi fees (32.5%):            -$16,250 COP
────────────────────────────────────────
NET PROFIT:                      $3,750 COP (7.5% margin)
```

**Key Insight:** Low-margin restaurants may struggle; high-margin items essential for profitability.

### Break-Even Analysis

**To maintain 15% profit margin on Rappi orders:**

Restaurant must achieve:
- Food cost: ≤25%
- Labor/overhead: ≤27.5%
- Rappi fees: 32.5%
- **Net profit:** 15%

OR

- Increase menu prices by 10-20% on Rappi (common strategy)
- Focus on high-margin items (beverages, appetizers)
- Optimize portions and preparation efficiency

### Success Formula

**For restaurant profitability on Rappi:**

1. **High-margin menu** (50%+ gross margin on popular items)
2. **Optimized pricing** (10-20% higher than in-restaurant)
3. **High volume** (to negotiate better commission rates)
4. **Operational efficiency** (low labor cost, fast prep)
5. **Strong ratings** (4.5+ stars for algorithm placement)
