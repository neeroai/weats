|------|-------------------|-------|
| Restaurant commission (6%) | $7,440 COP ($1.80) | |
| Data/Premium/Fintech | $3,000 COP ($0.73) | Allocated |
| **TOTAL REVENUE** | **$10,440 COP ($2.53)** | |

### Contribution Margin

```
Revenue per order: $10,440 COP ($2.53)
Variable cost per order: $5,690 COP ($1.38)
─────────────────────────────────────
Contribution margin: $4,750 COP ($1.15)
Contribution margin %: 45.5%
```

### Break-Even Calculation

**Monthly fixed costs: $55,000 USD = $227.7M COP**

```
Break-even orders = Fixed costs / Contribution margin
                  = $227.7M COP / $4,750 COP
                  = 47,936 orders/month
                  = 1,598 orders/day
```

**Year 1:** 100-200 orders/day (NOT break-even, need investment)
**Year 2:** 1,000-1,500 orders/day (APPROACHING break-even)
**Year 3:** 3,000-5,000 orders/day (PROFITABLE, 2-3x break-even)

## CUSTOMER LIFETIME VALUE (LTV)

### LTV Calculation

**Average Customer Behavior:**
- Orders per month: 4 (vs. Rappi 3-4 with subscription)
- Average order value: $30 USD
- Customer lifetime: 24 months (vs. Rappi 18-24)
- Retention rate: 85% monthly (vs. Rappi 75-80%)

**Gross Revenue:**
```
LTV = AOV × Orders/Month × Lifetime × Retention
    = $30 × 4 × 24 × 0.85
    = $2,448 per customer
```

**Net Contribution:**
```
Contribution margin per order: $1.15 USD
Lifetime orders: 4/month × 24 months × 0.85 = 81.6 orders
Lifetime contribution: 81.6 × $1.15 = $93.84

Minus CAC: $93.84 - $12 = $81.84 LTV

LTV/CAC ratio: 6.8:1 (excellent, >3:1 is healthy)
```

### Cohort Analysis (Projected)

| Cohort | Month 1 | Month 6 | Month 12 | Month 24 | Avg Orders/Month | LTV |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|----------|------------------|-----|
| **2025 Q1** | 100% | 90% | 85% | 75% | 4.2 | $98 |
| **2025 Q2** | 100% | 88% | 83% | 72% | 4.0 | $92 |
| **Rappi (est)** | 100% | 80% | 70% | 50% | 3.5 | $60 |

**Key Insight:** Weats customers are more loyal and order more frequently due to:
1. Zero fees = no deterrent to ordering
2. WhatsApp convenience = easier to reorder
3. Fair model = feel good about using service
4. AI personalization = better recommendations
