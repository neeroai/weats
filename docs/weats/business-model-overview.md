# WPFOODS BUSINESS MODEL OVERVIEW
## WhatsApp-Based Food Delivery Platform to Disrupt Rappi

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** October 11, 2025
**Mission:** Deliver food at zero cost to customers while empowering restaurants and workers

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

WPFoods is a WhatsApp-only food delivery platform designed to challenge Rappi's dominance by solving the fundamental economic pain points for all three stakeholders: customers pay **$0 service fees** and minimal delivery costs, restaurants pay **5-10% total fees** (vs. Rappi's 25-35%), and delivery workers earn **50-100% more per delivery** with expense support. The platform achieves profitability through **AI automation**, **data monetization** (B2B insights), **optional premium features**, and **financial services** - never by exploiting stakeholders.

### Core Innovation: The Anti-Rappi Model

**Problem:** Rappi extracts maximum value from all stakeholders
- Customers: 40% premium over restaurant prices
- Restaurants: 25-35% total costs destroy margins
- Workers: 48% pay decline, 40-60% expense burden, below minimum wage

**Solution:** WPFoods redistributes value fairly through technology
- **Customers:** $0 service fees, <$1,000 COP delivery (<$0.25 USD)
- **Restaurants:** 5-10% total fees (5-7x cheaper than Rappi)
- **Workers:** 50-100% higher pay, expense support, benefits pool

### Key Metrics (Target Year 3)

| Metric | WPFoods | Rappi | Advantage |
|--------|---------|-------|-----------|
| **Customer Cost** | $0 fees + minimal delivery | 15-20% service + $2-10K delivery | 5-10x cheaper |
| **Restaurant Fees** | 5-10% all-in | 25-35% all-in | 3-5x cheaper |
| **Worker Pay** | $3,500-$6,000 COP/delivery | $1,800-$3,700 COP/delivery | 50-100% higher |
| **Delivery Cost** | <$1,000 COP | $2,000-$10,000 COP | 70-90% cheaper |
| **Platform Cost** | 3-5% of GMV | 10% of GMV | 50% lower |
| **Revenue Model** | Data, premium, fintech | Commissions, ads, subs | Sustainable |

**4. WhatsApp Native**
- Can't be replicated by Rappi easily (requires rebuilding entire platform)
- Viral sharing built-in ("Order with me!" forwarded to friends)
- Lower customer acquisition cost (CAC) due to word-of-mouth

## RISK MITIGATION

### Key Risks & Mitigation Strategies

**1. Rappi Competitive Response**

**Risk:** Rappi slashes prices, copies model, sues for IP
**Probability:** High
**Impact:** High

**Mitigation:**
- **Move fast:** Establish brand and loyalty before Rappi reacts
- **IP protection:** Patent AI-driven WhatsApp ordering flow
- **Differentiation:** Brand as ethical alternative (hard to copy perception)
- **Geographic focus:** Dominate neighborhoods one by one (defensible)
- **Prepare for price war:** Maintain 12 months cash runway

**2. WhatsApp Policy Changes**

**Risk:** WhatsApp changes API pricing, restricts commerce, bans bot
**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** Critical

**Mitigation:**
- **Meta partnership:** Establish relationship with WhatsApp/Meta early
- **Compliance:** Strictly follow WhatsApp Business API terms
- **Revenue share:** Offer Meta revenue share if needed
- **Backup:** Build lightweight web app as backup (but keep WhatsApp primary)
- **Diversification:** Add other messaging platforms (Telegram, SMS) if needed

**3. Regulatory Intervention**

**Risk:** Government mandates minimum commissions, restricts data usage, forces worker classification
**Probability:** Low-Medium
**Impact:** Medium-High

**Mitigation:**
- **Proactive compliance:** Employee status for workers from day 1 (if economically viable)
- **Transparency:** Public reporting on worker pay, benefits
- **Lobbying:** Work with government on fair gig economy regulation
- **Data ethics:** Exceed privacy standards (GDPR-level compliance)
- **Public support:** Build grassroots movement (customers, workers, restaurants)

**4. Scaling Challenges**

**Risk:** Can't recruit enough workers, restaurants, or customers fast enough
**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium

**Mitigation:**
- **Worker recruitment:** 50-100% higher pay = easy to attract from Rappi
- **Restaurant recruitment:** 15-25 points savings = compelling value prop
- **Customer acquisition:** Word-of-mouth, viral, low-cost (WhatsApp sharing)
- **Focus:** Grow slowly, one neighborhood at a time (quality > speed)
- **Capital:** Raise sufficient funding for sustained growth

**5. Technology Failure**

**Risk:** AI breaks, WhatsApp API fails, system downtime loses customers
**Probability:** Low
**Impact:** High

**Mitigation:**
- **Redundancy:** Multiple AI providers (Gemini, OpenAI, Claude)
- **Infrastructure:** Vercel Edge Functions (99.99% uptime)
- **Testing:** Extensive QA, beta testing, gradual rollout
- **Support:** Human backup for AI failures (escalation path)
- **Monitoring:** Real-time alerts, rapid incident response

## CONCLUSION: WHY WPFOODS WILL WIN

### The Unfair Advantages

**1. Economics:** 91% lower operational costs (AI + WhatsApp) = can offer 3-5x cheaper service and still profit

**2. Distribution:** 90%+ WhatsApp penetration = zero customer acquisition friction

**3. Alignment:** Win-win-win model vs. Rappi's zero-sum extraction

**4. Technology:** AI-first from day 1 (vs. Rappi's legacy systems)

**5. Brand:** Ethical alternative vs. exploitative incumbent

### The Path Forward

**Year 1:** Prove model in Bogotá (10K customers, $5M GMV)
**Year 2:** Expand to 5 cities (50K customers, $30M GMV)
**Year 3:** National coverage (200K customers, $100M GMV, profitable)
**Year 5:** Regional leader (1M customers, $500M GMV, IPO-ready)

**Mission:** Make food delivery fair for everyone - customers, restaurants, and workers. Challenge Rappi's 64% market share not by competing on their terms, but by building a better, fairer, more sustainable platform that benefits all stakeholders.

**Tagline:** "WPFoods: Delivery without the fees. Powered by WhatsApp, driven by fairness."
