## Comprehensive Analysis of Gig Worker Economics and Conditions

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document provides an in-depth analysis of the rapitendero (delivery worker) experience on Rappi's platform. Rapitenderos are **independent contractors** who bear significant costs (40-60% of gross earnings) including vehicle maintenance, gas, insurance, and equipment. While Rappi promotes average earnings of $11,000 COP/hour ($2.65 USD), workers report declining per-delivery rates (48% reduction) and difficulty earning living wages after expenses.

### Key Findings for Workers

**EARNINGS:**
- Per-delivery: $1,800-$3,700 COP base + $1,000-$3,000 COP tips
- Rappi's claim: $11,000 COP/hour average
- Worker reality: Variable, declining over time
- Monthly potential: $800,000-$1,600,000 COP gross (full-time)
- **After expenses (40-60%):** $400,000-$1,000,000 COP net

**COSTS:**
- Startup: $89,500+ COP (backpack, uniform)
- Monthly expenses: $1,080,000-$2,500,000 COP
- Gas: 30-50% of daily earnings (motorized vehicles)
- Maintenance, insurance, social security, data, food

**STATUS:**
- Independent contractors (NOT employees)
- No benefits: health, pension, vacation, sick leave
- Must self-enroll in social security (own cost)
- 100% flexibility but 0% stability

**BOTTOM LINE:** Flexible income opportunity with low barriers to entry, but declining pay rates, high expenses, and lack of benefits make it challenging as primary income source. Best suited for part-time or supplemental income.

```
Gross monthly earnings: $1,500,000 COP
Expenses (50%): -$750,000 COP
────────────────────────────────
NET INCOME: $750,000 COP ($181 USD)

Below minimum wage: $1,300,000 COP (2024)
Shortfall: -$550,000 COP/month
```

## PERFORMANCE METRICS AND INCENTIVES

### Performance Tracking

**Metrics Monitored:**

**1. Delivery Completion Rate**
- Percentage of accepted orders completed
- Target: 95%+ (estimated)
- Impact: Low completion rate = fewer orders assigned

**2. Customer Ratings**
- 1-5 star ratings from customers
- Target: 4.5+ stars ideal
- Impact: Low ratings = deactivation risk

**3. On-Time Delivery Percentage**
- Deliveries within estimated time
- Critical for Rappi Turbo (90-second pickup, 10-min delivery)
- Impact: Late deliveries = lower ratings, fewer Turbo orders

**4. Acceptance Rate**
- Percentage of offered orders accepted
- No official target (but higher is better)
- Impact: Low acceptance = fewer offers (possible algorithm penalty)

**5. Cancellation Rate**
- Orders cancelled after acceptance
- Target: <5% (estimated)
- Impact: High cancellations = deactivation risk

**6. Active Hours**
- Time logged into app
- More hours = more order offers
- Impact: Algorithm may favor active workers

### Incentive Programs

**Performance Bonuses:**
- **Structure:** Not publicly detailed
- **Qualification:** High ratings, high volume, low cancellation

## CONCLUSION: IS RAPITENDERO WORK VIABLE?

### Work as Rapitendero IF:

✓ **You need flexible income** (between jobs, student, parent)
✓ **You have low startup costs** (own vehicle, smartphone, minimal debt)
✓ **You treat it as part-time** (supplemental income, not primary)
✓ **You can work peak hours** (lunch, dinner, weekends)
✓ **You have low expenses** (bicycle delivery, live with family)
✓ **You're strategic** (multi-app, optimize zones, track metrics)
✓ **You have safety net** (savings, family support, alternative income)
✓ **You're young and healthy** (physically demanding work)

### Reconsider or Avoid IF:

✗ **You need stable income** (bills, family, debt)
✗ **You have high expenses** (car, rent, dependents)
✗ **You need benefits** (health insurance, pension critical)
✗ **You can't work peak hours** (family obligations, other job)
✗ **You value safety** (high accident risk, crime)
✗ **You're risk-averse** (no income guarantee)
✗ **You need long-term security** (retirement, career path)
✗ **You have health issues** (physically demanding, no sick leave)

### Economic Viability Analysis

**Part-Time (20 hours/week):**
```
Gross monthly: $640,000 COP
Expenses (50%): -$320,000 COP
Net monthly: $320,000 COP ($77 USD)

Below minimum wage: $1,300,000 COP
Viability: As supplemental income only
```

**Full-Time (60 hours/week):**
```
Gross monthly: $1,920,000 COP
Expenses (50%): -$960,000 COP
Net monthly: $960,000 COP ($232 USD)

Below minimum wage: $1,300,000 COP
Viability: Barely survival, unsustainable
```

**Extreme Full-Time (70+ hours/week):**
```
Gross monthly: $2,800,000 COP
Expenses (45%): -$1,260,000 COP
Net monthly: $1,540,000 COP ($372 USD)

Barely above minimum wage: $1,300,000 COP
Viability: Possible but exhausting, no long-term future
```

### Sustainability Concerns

**For Workers:**
- **Declining pay:** 48% reduction in minimum rate
- **Rising expenses:** Gas, maintenance, insurance increasing
- **No benefits:** Health, pension, paid leave absent
- **Physical toll:** Injuries, exhaustion, aging
- **Mental stress:** Anxiety, insecurity, isolation
- **No retirement:** Can't save, no pension, uncertain future

**For Rappi:**
- **Labor unrest:** Protests, unionization, negative publicity
- **Regulatory risk:** Forced reclassification, minimum wage mandates
- **Quality concerns:** Overworked workers = poor service
- **High turnover:** Constant recruitment, training costs
- **Reputational damage:** Exploitation narrative

### Recommendations for Potential Workers

**BEFORE STARTING:**
1. **Calculate true costs:** Track all expenses for first month
2. **Test part-time first:** Don't quit day job immediately
3. **Compare alternatives:** Other gig platforms, traditional employment
4. **Save emergency fund:** 3-6 months expenses
5. **Understand risks:** No benefits, no stability, declining pay

**IF WORKING AS RAPITENDERO:**
1. **Track everything:** Income, expenses, hours (for true hourly rate)
2. **Optimize efficiency:** Best zones, peak hours, multi-app
3. **Minimize expenses:** Bicycle if possible, maintenance DIY
4. **Build skills:** Customer service, efficiency, navigation
5. **Plan exit:** Save money, develop skills, apply to better jobs
6. **Don't rely 100%:** Keep other income options open
7. **Protect yourself:** Health insurance, emergency fund, safety gear
8. **Join unions/groups:** Collective advocacy, peer support

**EXIT STRATEGY:**
- **Time limit:** Set max duration (e.g., 1 year)
- **Savings goal:** Use for specific financial objective
- **Skill building:** Learn while earning
- **Apply to jobs:** Continuously seek better opportunities
- **Network:** Build connections for next step

### Bottom Line

Rapitendero work offers **flexibility and low barriers to entry** but at the cost of **declining pay, high expenses, and zero benefits**. After expenses, most workers earn below minimum wage even working 60+ hours per week. **Best suited for part-time or transitional income**, not sustainable long-term career. Workers must carefully calculate true net earnings, optimize for efficiency, and plan exit strategy. The gig economy model **transfers risk to workers** while providing minimal support, making it economically precarious for most.
