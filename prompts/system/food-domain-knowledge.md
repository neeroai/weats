## Delivery Logistics

### Distance & Time Calculations

**Standard Delivery Zones** (Bogot√° reference):
```
Zone 1: 0-2 km    ‚Üí 15-20 min delivery ‚Üí $0 delivery fee
Zone 2: 2-4 km    ‚Üí 20-30 min delivery ‚Üí $0 delivery fee
Zone 3: 4-6 km    ‚Üí 30-40 min delivery ‚Üí $2,000 fee (rare)
Zone 4: 6+ km     ‚Üí Not currently serviced
```

**Preparation Times** (by cuisine type):
```
Fast Food (burgers, pizza):        10-15 min
Colombian (bandeja, corrientazo):  15-20 min
Sushi/Asian:                       15-20 min
Fine dining/complex:               20-30 min
```

**Total Order Time** = Preparation + Pickup (2-5 min) + Delivery

**Example Calculations**:
```
Pizza, 3 km distance:
- Preparation: 15 min
- Pickup: 3 min
- Delivery: 12 min
- Total: 30 minutes ‚úÖ

Bandeja Paisa, 5 km distance:
- Preparation: 20 min
- Pickup: 4 min
- Delivery: 16 min
- Total: 40 minutes
```

### Worker Dispatch Algorithm

**Matching Criteria** (in priority order):
1. **Availability**: Worker currently available (not on delivery)
2. **Proximity**: Within 1 km of restaurant (PostGIS query)
3. **Rating**: Worker rating >4.5 stars
4. **Capacity**: Worker can complete delivery within 30 min window
5. **History**: Worker has delivered from this restaurant before (bonus)

**PostGIS Query Pattern**:
```sql
SELECT worker_id, current_location,
       ST_Distance(current_location, restaurant_location) as distance
FROM workers
WHERE status = 'available'
  AND ST_DWithin(current_location, restaurant_location, 1000) -- 1km
  AND rating >= 4.5
ORDER BY distance ASC, rating DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Fallback Strategy**:
- No workers within 1 km ‚Üí Expand to 2 km
- No workers within 2 km ‚Üí Expand to 3 km (offer customer delay warning)
- No workers within 3 km ‚Üí Suggest alternative restaurant or delay order

**Multi-Order Batching** (Future feature):
- Worker can carry 2-3 orders if routes align
- AI optimizes route using PostGIS + Google Maps API
- Ensures no order delayed >10 minutes
- Higher earnings for worker ($10,000-15,000 per trip)

### Real-Time Tracking

**Technology Stack**:
- **Location updates**: Worker app sends GPS every 30 seconds
- **Storage**: Supabase Realtime with PostGIS POINT updates
- **Customer view**: WhatsApp location sharing (live link)
- **ETA calculation**: Google Maps Distance Matrix API

**Location Sharing Protocol**:
1. Worker picks up order ‚Üí Start location tracking
2. Every 30 seconds: Update worker location in Supabase
3. Every 2 minutes: Send location link to customer via WhatsApp
4. Significant change (ETA +/- 5 min): Immediate customer update
5. Arrival (<500m): Send "arriving soon" notification

**Privacy Considerations**:
- Worker location shared ONLY during active delivery
- Location history deleted after 7 days
- Customer location shown to worker as destination only (not exact until 500m away)
