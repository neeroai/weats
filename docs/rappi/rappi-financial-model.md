## REVENUE STREAMS BREAKDOWN

### 1. Merchant Commissions (75% - $975 Million)

**Primary Revenue Source**

**Commission Structure:**
- **Range:** 15-30% of order value
- **Typical:** 20-25% for most restaurants
- **Average:** ~22.5%

**By Merchant Category:**

| Category | Commission Range | Volume Share |
|----------|------------------|--------------|
| **Restaurants (Food)** | 20-30% | 60% of GMV |
| **Grocery Stores** | 10-25% | 20% of GMV |
| **Pharmacies** | 15-25% | 10% of GMV |
| **Other Retail** | 15-25% | 10% of GMV |

**Commission Calculation Example:**
```
Restaurant Order: $50,000 COP
Commission rate: 25%
Commission revenue: $12,500 COP
Annual scale: $975M / $1.3B = 75% of revenue
```

**Factors Determining Rate:**
- Order volume (higher volume = lower rate)
- Exclusivity agreements (exclusive = lower rate)
- Restaurant category (fine dining vs. fast food)
- Geographic location (urban vs. suburban)
- Contract length (long-term = better rates)
- Marketing participation (featured = may increase rate)

**Commission Models:**

**Model 1: Flat Rate (Most Common)**
- Fixed percentage per order
- Example: 25% on every order
- Simple, predictable

**Model 2: Tiered Volume**
- Decreasing percentage as volume increases
- Example:
  - 0-100 orders/month: 28%
  - 101-500 orders/month: 24%
  - 500+ orders/month: 20%

**Model 3: Hybrid**
- Base rate + performance bonuses
- Example: 22% base with 2% rebate for >500 orders/month

**Revenue Optimization:**
- High commission rates (20-25%) on most transactions
- Volume-based pricing encourages merchant growth
- Exclusivity deals secure long-term revenue
- Category-specific rates maximize revenue per vertical

### 2. Payment Processing Fees (Embedded in Commissions)

**Hidden Revenue Stream**

**Merchant Fees:**
- **Rate:** 2-3% of transaction value
- **Charged to:** Restaurants and merchants
- **Actual cost:** ~1-1.5% (credit card processing)
- **Margin:** 0.5-1.5% pure profit

**Calculation:**
```
Order value: $50,000 COP
Processing fee (2.5%): $1,250 COP
Actual cost (1.5%): $750 COP
Rappi margin: $500 COP (40% margin on processing)
```

**Annual Scale:**
```
GMV: $3.17 billion
Processing fee (2.5% average): $79.25M
Actual cost (1.5%): $47.55M
Net margin: $31.7M additional revenue
```

**Significance:**
- Often overlooked revenue stream
- High-margin (40%+)
- Scales with GMV
- Minimal operational cost

```

### 4. Subscription Revenue (10% - $130 Million)

**Rappi Prime & Pro Programs**

**Subscription Tiers (Colombia):**

| Tier | Price/Month (COP) | Price/Month (USD) | Key Benefits |
|------|------------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Prime Basic** | $14,500 | $3.50 | Free delivery (conditions) |
| **Prime Plus** | $24,900 | $5.50 | Unlimited free delivery |
| **Pro Black** | $29,900 | $7.50 | Free delivery + 20% off service fees + 3% cashback |

**Subscriber Estimates:**

**Colombia (Primary Market):**
- Est. subscribers: 500,000-800,000
- Mix: 40% Basic, 40% Plus, 20% Pro Black
- Avg. subscription value: $20,000 COP/month ($4.85 USD)
- Monthly revenue (Colombia): $10-16M COP = $2.4-3.9M USD

**Latin America (9 Countries):**
- Est. total subscribers: 2-3 million
- Varies by market penetration
- Average monthly ARPU: ~$4.50 USD
- Monthly revenue (LatAm): $9-13.5M USD
- **Annual revenue: $108-162M USD** (aligns with $130M estimate)

**Subscription Economics:**

**Customer Perspective:**
```
Pro Black subscription: $29,900 COP/month

Benefits per order (avg):
- Delivery fee saved: $4,500 COP
- Service fee discount (20%): $1,080 COP
- Cashback (3%): $900 COP
Total value per order: $6,480 COP

Break-even: 5 orders/month (29,900 / 6,480 = 4.6)
Frequent users (10 orders): Save $35,000 COP/month net
```

**Rappi Perspective:**
```
Pro Black subscriber paying $29,900 COP/month
Orders per month: 10 (typical frequent user)

Revenue foregone:
- Delivery fees: $45,000 COP (10 × $4,500)
- Service fee discount: $10,800 COP
Total foregone: $55,800 COP

Net cost: $55,800 - $29,900 = -$25,900 COP loss per sub

BUT: Increased order frequency (10 vs. 3-4 without sub)
- 6 additional orders × $7 profit/order = $42 USD = $170,000 COP additional profit
- Net benefit: $170,000 - $106,000 = +$64,000 COP per sub/month
```

**Strategic Value:**
- **Predictable recurring revenue**
- **Customer retention** (lock-in)
- **Increased order frequency** (subscribers order 2-3x more)
- **Higher lifetime value** (LTV)
- **Data advantage** (subscription users more engaged)
- **Competitive moat** (switching costs)

**Churn Rate:**
- Estimated: 5-8% monthly (industry standard)
- Retention focus: Exclusive deals, perks, seamless experience

### 5. Service Fees (Customer-Facing, ~$330 Million)

**Platform Operational Fee**

**Structure:**
- **Rate:** 15-20% of order subtotal
- **Applied to:** All orders (subscription or not)
- **Discount:** 20% off with Pro Black subscription

**Calculation:**
```
Order subtotal: $30,000 COP
Service fee (18%): $5,400 COP

Annual scale:
105.6M orders/year × avg $30 order × 18% = $568M
After Pro Black discounts (~30% of orders): ~$490M
After operational costs: ~$330M net contribution
```

**What It Covers:**
- Platform technology and maintenance
- Customer support operations
- Payment processing infrastructure
- Order management systems
- Real-time tracking technology
- App development and updates

**Margin Analysis:**
- High-margin revenue (80%+ margin)
- Scales with order volume
- Minimal incremental cost per order
- Pure platform revenue

### 6. Delivery Fees (Revenue Neutral / Slight Margin)

**Customer Delivery Charges**

**Structure:**
- **Rate:** $2,000-$10,000 COP per order ($0.50-$2.40 USD)
- **Dynamic pricing:** Distance, demand, time
- **Collected from:** Customer
- **Paid to:** Rapitendero (100% of fee)

**Economic Flow:**
```
Customer pays: $4,000 COP delivery fee
Rapitendero receives: $4,000 COP

Rappi margin: $0 (pass-through)
```

**However:**
- Some sources suggest Rappi keeps $1.50-$3.50 per delivery
- If true, this generates additional revenue:
  ```
  105.6M orders × $2.50 avg = $264M additional revenue
  ```

**Clarification Needed:**
- Conflicting reports on whether 100% goes to rapitendero
- May vary by market or delivery type (Turbo vs. standard)
- Potential source of hidden revenue

**Assumption for this analysis:**
- Mostly pass-through to rapitendero
- Rappi keeps small margin ($0.50-$1.00 per delivery)
- Estimated annual: ~$50-100M

### 7. E-Commerce Revenue (2% - $26 Million)

**Business Model:**
- **Rappi owns inventory:** Purchases from wholesalers
- **Dark stores:** 60+ in Colombia (2021 data)

**Revenue Model:**
```
Wholesale cost: $10,000 COP
Retail price: $14,000 COP

Rappi revenue: $4,000 COP (markup minus delivery cost)
```

**Annual Estimates:**
- Turbo orders: ~10% of total orders = 10.6M/year
- Avg Turbo order value: $25,000 COP
- Markup: 30-40%
- Gross revenue: $265M
- After COGS and delivery: ~$26M net (2% of total)

**Categories:**

## UNIT ECONOMICS PER ORDER

### Standard Order Breakdown

**Example: $50,000 COP Restaurant Order**

**MONEY IN (Rappi Receives):**

**From Customer:**
```
Product price: $50,000 COP (goes to restaurant, Rappi facilitates)
Service fee (18%): $9,000 COP → RAPPI
Delivery fee: $4,000 COP → Passes to rapitendero
Tip: $3,000 COP → Passes to rapitendero (0% kept)
─────────────────────────────────────
Total customer pays: $66,000 COP
Rappi collects: $66,000 COP
Rappi keeps from customer: $9,000 COP (service fee)
```

**From Restaurant:**
```
Product price: $50,000 COP
Commission (25%): $12,500 COP → RAPPI
Payment processing (2.5%): $1,250 COP → RAPPI
Delivery service fee: $2,500 COP → RAPPI (if using Rappi fleet)
─────────────────────────────────────
Total restaurant charges: $16,250 COP
Rappi revenue from restaurant: $16,250 COP
```

**TOTAL RAPPI REVENUE PER ORDER:**
```
From customer (service fee): $9,000 COP
From restaurant (commission): $12,500 COP
From restaurant (processing): $1,250 COP
From restaurant (delivery fee): $2,500 COP
─────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL REVENUE: $25,250 COP (~$6.10 USD)
```

**MONEY OUT (Rappi Pays):**

**To Rapitendero:**
```
Delivery fee: $4,000 COP (from customer)
Tip (pass-through): $3,000 COP (from customer, 0% kept)
─────────────────────────────────────
Total to rapitendero: $7,000 COP
```

**To Restaurant:**
```
Product price: $50,000 COP
Less commission: -$12,500 COP
Less processing: -$1,250 COP
Less delivery fee: -$2,500 COP
─────────────────────────────────────
Net to restaurant: $33,750 COP
Payment schedule: Weekly/bi-weekly
```

**Operational Costs (Rappi):**
```
Payment processing (actual cost): $700 COP (1.5% of $50K)
Platform/infrastructure: $1,500 COP/order (estimated)
Customer support: $500 COP/order (estimated)
Marketing/acquisition: $800 COP/order (amortized)
─────────────────────────────────────
Total operational costs: $3,500 COP
```

**RAPPI NET PROFIT PER ORDER:**
```
Total revenue: $25,250 COP
Less rapitendero: -$4,000 COP (delivery fee paid out)
Less operational costs: -$3,500 COP
─────────────────────────────────────
NET PROFIT: $17,750 COP (~$4.29 USD)

Profit margin: 70% (on Rappi revenue)
Take rate: 38% (Rappi keeps $25,250 of $66,000 customer payment)
```

**NOTE:** This assumes restaurant delivery fee ($2,500) goes to Rappi. If it goes to rapitendero, profit is lower (~$15,250 COP = $3.69 USD per order).

### Turbo Order Economics (Higher Margin)

**Example: $25,000 COP Turbo Order (Own Inventory)**

**MONEY IN:**
```
Product wholesale cost: $17,500 COP (Rappi buys)
Retail price to customer: $25,000 COP
Markup: $7,500 COP (43%)

Service fee (18%): $4,500 COP
Delivery fee (premium): $5,000 COP
─────────────────────────────────────
Total customer pays: $34,500 COP
Rappi gross revenue: $34,500 COP
```

**MONEY OUT:**
```
COGS (product cost): $17,500 COP
Rapitendero (delivery + tip): $7,500 COP
Operational costs: $2,000 COP
─────────────────────────────────────
Total costs: $27,000 COP
```

**NET PROFIT:**
```
Revenue: $34,500 COP
Costs: $27,000 COP
─────────────────────────────────────
NET PROFIT: $7,500 COP (~$1.81 USD)

Profit margin: 22% (lower than restaurant orders)
```

**Turbo Advantage:**
- **Speed:** 10 minutes (competitive edge)
- **Control:** Inventory and fulfillment controlled
- **Volume:** Encourages more orders (convenience)
- **Customer retention:** Premium experience

### Subscription Order Economics (Lower Margin)

**Example: Pro Black Subscriber Order**

**Without Subscription:**
```
Service fee (18%): $5,400 COP
Delivery fee: $4,500 COP
Rappi revenue: $9,900 COP
```

**With Pro Black Subscription:**
```
Service fee (14.4%, -20%): $4,320 COP
Delivery fee (free): $0 COP
Rappi revenue per order: $4,320 COP

Revenue foregone: $5,580 COP per order
```

**However:**
- Subscriber orders 10× per month (vs. 3× without)
- 7 incremental orders × $7 profit = $49 USD = $202,500 COP
- Plus subscription fee: $29,900 COP
- **Net benefit:** $232,400 COP/month vs. $182,700 COP (3 orders × profit)
- **27% increase** in monthly revenue per customer

**Key Insight:** Lower margin per order, but higher order frequency and LTV.

**Note:** $715M commission revenue lower than $975M reported. Difference includes payment processing fees, delivery fees kept, and other merchant fees.

### Take Rate Analysis

**Rappi Take Rate: 41%**

**Definition:** Rappi revenue as percentage of GMV

**Calculation:**
```
Rappi revenue: $1.3B
GMV: $3.17B
Take rate: $1.3B / $3.17B = 41%
```

**Comparison to Competitors:**

| Platform | Take Rate | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Rappi** | 41% | High take rate, multiple revenue streams |
| **Uber Eats** | 35-40% | Similar, but higher delivery costs |

- Rapitendero payment: $4,500 COP
- Platform/infrastructure: $2,000 COP
- Customer support: $700 COP
- Marketing (amortized): $1,200 COP
- Payment processing (actual): $1,240 COP
─────────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL COSTS: $9,640 COP (~$2.33 USD)

NET PROFIT PER ORDER: $45,300 COP (~$10.95 USD)

## CONCLUSION: FINANCIAL MODEL VIABILITY

### Business Model Strengths

✓ **Diversified revenue:** 75% commissions, 13% ads, 10% subscriptions, 2% e-commerce
✓ **High take rate:** 41% of GMV (industry-leading)
✓ **Profitable unit economics:** $7 USD profit per order
✓ **Operational efficiency:** 10% delivery cost (best in class)
✓ **Market leadership:** 64% share in Colombia (pricing power)
✓ **Economies of scale:** 105.6M orders/year (leverage fixed costs)
✓ **Super-app moat:** Financial services create stickiness
✓ **Break-even achieved:** 2023 milestone demonstrates path to profitability

### Financial Model Risks

✗ **Geographic concentration:** 64% Colombia vs. weak elsewhere
✗ **Recent profitability:** Only break-even in 2023 (sustainability uncertain)
✗ **Growth investments:** $739M profit potential offset by expansion spending
✗ **Competition intensity:** iFood, Uber Eats, DiDi, PedidosYa well-funded
✗ **Margin pressure:** Commission rates, worker pay, regulatory costs
✗ **Regulatory risk:** Worker reclassification could add 30-40% labor costs
✗ **Market volatility:** LatAm economic and currency risks

### Investment Recommendation

**CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC**

**For investors:**
- Strong unit economics and operational efficiency
- Diversified revenue model reduces single-point failure
- Market leadership in Colombia provides foundation
- Break-even achievement demonstrates viability
- IPO timing (2025-2026) may benefit from market recovery
- **Valuation:** $5.25B reasonable at 4.0x revenue, but growth must continue

**For market entry/competition:**
- Difficult to displace Rappi in Colombia (64% share, network effects)
- Opportunities in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina (weak Rappi presence)
- Differentiation required (worker welfare, niche categories, technology)
- Capital requirements substantial ($2.46B raised by Rappi)

**For restaurants:**
- Platform provides access to largest customer base (Colombia)
- 20-25% commission + fees significant but industry-standard
- Must optimize menu for high-margin items to remain profitable
- Multi-platform strategy recommended (reduce dependency)

**For workers:**
- Unit economics challenging (40-60% expenses, declining pay)
- Best suited for part-time or supplemental income
- Full-time work yields below minimum wage after expenses
- Flexibility attractive, but sustainability questionable

### Bottom Line

Rappi has built a **financially viable business model** with strong unit economics, diversified revenue, and operational efficiency. The **41% take rate** and **$7 profit per order** demonstrate that the core business works at scale. However, **profitability is recent** (2023 break-even) and **sustainability depends on** managing competition, maintaining commission rates, controlling labor costs, and expanding high-margin revenue streams (advertising, financial services, subscriptions). The **IPO readiness** and **$5.25B valuation** are justified by current performance, but growth must continue to deliver shareholder returns. **Geographic diversification** beyond Colombia is critical for long-term success.
